# poof ü™Ñ - magic manager of pre-built software

Easy-to-use all-in-one binary with zero-config, zero-install, and zero-dependencies.

You just run `poof install someuser/somerepo` and... *poof!* it is installed and available in your shell.

**Note: this project is actively being developed.** I'm making ongoing improvements to the code while trying to maintain stability and up-to-date documentation. However, things may break. If you encounter some issues during this development phase, please [report them](https://github.com/pirafrank/poof/issues). Thank you!

## Features

- **üõ†Ô∏è Zero-config**: Works immediately without any setup required for first run
- **üì¶ Zero-install**: Simply download the binary for your platform and use it right away
- **üîó Zero-dependencies**: It runs standalone without requiring any additional software
- **üë§ User-space**: Designed to work in user-space, no root access needed
- **üåç Cross-platform**: Works on Linux and macOS and runs on different architectures (FreeBSD and Windows support is planned)
- **üöÄ Easy to use**: Sensible commands that are easy to remember and to type. Just run `poof help` to know more.

Bonus:

- **‚öôÔ∏è Written in Rust**: Safe and fast binaries built on reliable dependencies, with linting and formatting applied at commit time
- **0Ô∏è‚É£ Zero-versioned**: Because major versions are [a thing of the past](https://0ver.org/) (and *poof*, albeit magic, is baby).

## Why

More and more often modern tools are built with languages like Rust and Go, and offer pre-built binaries. But they aren't always available in standard package managers. Here's where `poof` helps:

- Download and put in `$PATH` binaries from GitHub with a single command
- Install tools discovered on sites like [Terminal Trove](http://terminaltrove.com) instantly
- Test newer versions of tools before they reach official repositories without uninstalling your current version
- Fast jump on interesting utilities you read about without hassle
- Prefer use of pre-built, portable, self-contained binaries without involving system package managers

## Quick start

1. Get `poof` using one of the methods below:
    - **Pre-built binary**: Download the binary from [latest release](https://github.com/pirafrank/poof/releases), and move it to some directory in your `$PATH`.
    - **binstall**: If you have [binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall), you can get the binary using `cargo` and skip compilation:

    ```sh
    cargo binstall poof
    ```

    - **cargo**: Build and install latest release on crates.io using `cargo`:

    ```sh
    cargo install --locked poof
    ```

2. Add poof's `bin` directory to `$PATH` by running:

    ```sh
    poof enable
    ```

    Then reload you shell.

3. **Done!** Now try to install something, for example:

    ```sh
    poof install pirafrank/rust_exif_renamer
    ```

Additional information about [installation](https://github.com/pirafrank/poof/wiki/How-to-install) and [supported platforms](https://github.com/pirafrank/poof/wiki/Supported-platforms) is available in the Wiki.

## About poof's `bin` directory

`poof` installs and symlinks binaries in its own data directory.

Having a dedicated directory for `poof` binaries is a good practice, as it allows you to:

- keep them separate from other software installed on your system,
- keep them separate from paths you may manually edit (like `~/.local/bin`),
- easily temporarily disable `poof` by removing the directory from your `$PATH` (read below).

## Disable

poof's `bin` directory by default is added at the beginning of `$PATH` so that it takes precedence over any other version of same-named binary you may have installed other ways.

If you want to halt this behavior, you can [disable it](https://github.com/pirafrank/poof/wiki/Disable) it temporarily or permanently.

## Documentation

Updated documentation for the latest release is available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/pirafrank/poof/wiki).

## Project goals

- Fetch and put in `$PATH` pre-built binaries available on Internet
- Work without requiring buckets, repositories, or registries
- Work out-of-the-box with no setup or configuration needed
- Be designed to in user-space
- Be as cross-platform as possible
- Be easy to use, with sensible and ergonomic commands and options
- Have no external dependencies

## Non-goals

- Build software from source code
- Manage software that doesn't provide pre-built binaries
- Act as a general package manager
- Manage software installed by other tools or package managers
  - Replace or modify binaries installed by other package managers
  - Manage dependencies required by the software
  - Handle language-specific package managers (pip, npm, cargo, etc.)
  - Interface with system package managers (apt, yum, brew, etc.)
